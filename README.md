A modal scale operator with numerical input for scaling selection to specific dimensions. Works with Transform Orientation and Trransform Pivot Point settings. 
The idea is to set a hotkey for it or to add it to Quick Favourites menu. It' in Mesh Transform menu in edit mode:

It scales the bounding box of selected elements:

The pivot point and orientation of the operation is controlled by setting usual transform settings: Transform Pivot Point and Transform Orientation:

It works with the native unit conversion system so units and math operations can be entered while in operation or in the operators panel after the operation:

For convenience <kbd> Tab </kbd>(and MMB) cycles the axis so it's easy to enter all dimensions all at once. 

There is uniform mode toggled with <kbd> U </kbd> that scales the other axis based on the active one keeping the original proportions.
